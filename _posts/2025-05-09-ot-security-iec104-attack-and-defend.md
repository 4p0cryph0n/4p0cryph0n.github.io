## Objective ##
In the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, let us have a look at a rapidly developing domain in cyber-security; Operational Technology (OT) Security. In this post, we will be engaging in an attack and defend exercise targeting IEC 104 - a communication protocol used by various types of OT/ICS systems.

## Threats towards OT Systems - A Quick Introduction
In order for us to understand the importance of OT security and the ever-growing threat landscape, let's take a look at a geo-political warfare case.

During the Russia-Ukraine war, [Mandiant](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/sandworm-disrupts-power-ukraine-operational-technology/) documented a coordinated cyber campaign by Russian state-sponsored threat groups. A key aggressor in this campaign was an APT tracked as Sandworm (a.k.a APT44), which has been attributed to Russian intelligence (GRU).

Sandworm utilized custom OT/ICS malware, namely INDUSTROYER.V2, to perform targeted attacks on Ukraine energy infrastructure. These attacks were coordinated with physical missile and drone attacks on substations to increase damage and gain tactical advantage, especially since this war was going on during the winters.

This case, among many, shows the rapid evolution of OT threats and how they fit into the bigger pictures such as cyberwarfare. It also highlights the importance of shifting our glance as an industry to securing these OT/ICS systems in order to ensure that critical infrastructure stays secure and provides continuous services during wars and other disturbances.

## IEC 104 - Overview

IEC 104 (IEC-60870-5-104) is a communication protocol that is utilized by many types of OT/ICS and SCADA systems especially those that are a part of energy and power infrastructure. 

It facilitates remote control and monitoring over TCP/IP and is usually used for connecting control centers (client/master) to RTU/IEDs and substations (server/slave). Using this protocol, several data points such as breaker status, tank levels, etc. can be monitored, ingested, and controlled.
