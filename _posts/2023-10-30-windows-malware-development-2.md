## Objective ##

Hey guys, welcome to the second part of Windows Malware Development, where we will be beginning with the basics of payload placement. In this post, we will be looking at how to place our shellcode in the `.text` section.

## .text Section ##

If you recall from the previous post, the `.text` section contains code that needs to be executed by the program. For example, any code that lies within the `main` function of your program goes in the `.text` section.

In this example, we will be looking at a basic program that:
- Stores shellcode in a memory buffer.
- Makes that buffer executable in nature.
- Executes the shellcode.

**_NOTE:_**  You will need Visual Studio/Visual studio build tools and x64dbg for this exercise.
