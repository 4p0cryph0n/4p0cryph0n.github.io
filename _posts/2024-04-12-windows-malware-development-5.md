## Objective ##
Hey guys, welcome to the fifth part of Windows Malware Development, in which we will look at how to encrypt our malicious shellcode using the RC4 cryptographic algorithm.

## Payload Encryption ##
Malware authors use encryption algorithms to hide the malicious content placed inside a binary. Encryption can help beat signature-based detection, but has a higher chance of failing against other detection mechanisms such as run-time analysis.
