## Objective ##

Hey guys! Welcome to the first post in a series of posts aimed at learning Windows malware development! In this post, we will be looking at the PE file format, which is an important step in learning how to make a Windows executable.

## What is a PE? ##
A Portable Executable (PE) is a file format for executable files that can be understood and run by the Windows OS. The PE format is one of the file formats that are known as  Common Object File Format (COFF) files.

This format does not only apply for `.exe` files, but is also used for Dynamic Link Libraries (`.dll`), driver configuration files (`.sys`),  Screen Saver files (`.scr`), and more.

The PE file format is a very important part of the Windows OS, since it contains necessary information required in order for the OS to load an executable in to memory and execute it.
