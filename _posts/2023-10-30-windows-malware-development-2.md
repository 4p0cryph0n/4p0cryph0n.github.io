## Objective ##

Hey guys, welcome to the second part of Windows Malware Development, in which we will be beginning with the basics of payload placement. In this post, we will be looking at how to place our shellcode in the `.text` section.

## .text Section ##

If you recall from the previous post, the `.text` section contains code that needs to be executed by the program. For example, any code that lies within the `main` function of your program goes in the `.text` section.

In this example, we will be looking at a basic program that:
- Stores shellcode in a memory buffer.
- Makes that buffer executable in nature.
- Executes the shellcode.

>You will need Visual Studio/Visual studio build tools and x64dbg for this exercise.

## Writing the program ##

### Defining the Shellcode Array ###

We will first start off by defining a character array that initially holds our shellcode. 

Instead of using the basic method of directly initializing a character array with our shellcode in main itself, we can use the directive `#pragma section(".text")` in order to specify the section, and then use `__declspec` in order to place our shellcode in `.text`:
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <windows.h>

#pragma section(".text")
__declspec(allocate(".text")) const unsigned char Text_RawData[] = {
    0x90,    // NOP
    0x90,    // NOP
    0xcc,    // INT3
    0xc3     // RET
};
```

The shellcode here in question is a series of assembly instruction that goes as follows:
- `0x90`: No operation (NOP)
- `0x90`: No operation (NOP)
- `0xcc`: Break
- `0xc3`: Return (RET)

This is essentially a test shellcode, and its only function is to break the execution flow of our program. Why I'm using this particular shellcode is because we will be inspecting this program in the debugger later, and the `0xcc` instruction will help us with that.

### Allocating a Memory Buffer ###

Now, let's allocate a memory buffer for storing our shellcode. We will be using the Windows API `VirtualAlloc` for this. Taking a look at documentation for `VirtualAlloc`, we can see that it takes 4 parameters:

```cpp
LPVOID VirtualAlloc(
  [in, optional] LPVOID lpAddress,
  [in]           SIZE_T dwSize,
  [in]           DWORD  flAllocationType,
  [in]           DWORD  flProtect
);
```

- `[in, optional] lpAddress`: An optional parameter that holds a pointer to the address of the memory allocation location.
- `[in] dwSize`: Size of the memory region in bytes.
- `[in] flAllocationType`: Specifies the type of memory allocation.
- `[in] flProtect`: Specifies the memory protection to be applied on the allocated pages of memory.

We will be using `VirtualAlloc` in the following manner:
```cpp
int main() {
    printf("[i] Text_RawData function: 0x%p \n", Text_RawData);

    // Allocate executable memory.
    size_t codeSize = sizeof(Text_RawData);
    void* executableMemory = VirtualAlloc(NULL, codeSize, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);

    if (executableMemory == NULL) {
        printf("VirtualAlloc Failed With Error : %d \n", GetLastError());
        return -1;
    }
```

As you can see, for the `flAllocationType` parameter, we have used the combined flag `MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE`. The operation is explained as follows:
- `MEM_COMMIT`: Used for committing physical memory to the specified region.
- `MEM_RESERVE`: Used for reserving address space in the process's virtual address space.
  
By using the combined flags, we have essentially both committed and reserved space for our shellcode in the process's memory.

### Making the Memory Region Executable  ###

>You can directly do this in `VirtualAlloc` itself, however, I will be doing this extra step for the purpose of practice and understanding the `VirtualProtect` API.

In order for us to be able to execute our shellcode, we will have to first move it into our newly allocated memory region, and make said region executable.

To move the shellcode, we will be using the `memcpy` function, copying our shellcode from the character array to the newly allocated memory region.

```cpp
    // Copy the shellcode from Text_RawData to the executable memory.
    memcpy(executableMemory, Text_RawData, codeSize);
```

To make the memory region where our shellcode is stored executable, we will be using `VirtualProtect`. Taking a look at documentation for `VirtualProtect`, we can see that it takes 4 parameters:

```cpp
BOOL VirtualProtect(
  [in]  LPVOID lpAddress,
  [in]  SIZE_T dwSize,
  [in]  DWORD  flNewProtect,
  [out] PDWORD lpflOldProtect
);
```

- `[in]  DWORD  flNewProtect`: The memory protection to be set.
- `[out] PDWORD lpflOldProtect`: The old memory protection settings.

>An `[out]` parameter is a value returned by the function that is usually sent back to the caller for future processing or other operations that need to be done. 
> 
>You can think of it as an additional return value. In this case, `VirtualProtect` stores the old memory protection settings in the variable `lpflOldProtect` of type `PDWORD`, in case the user wants to restore these settings.
